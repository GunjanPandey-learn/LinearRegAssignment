## General Information
- To develop best fitted linear regression model
- Top three features which are contributing towards demand

## Conclusions
  The equation of our best fitted line is: cnt=.269+(.256* yr) - (.081 * holiday) + (.414 * temp) - (.137 * windspeed) - (.142 * season_spring) + (.080 * season_winter) -(.058 * mnth_dec) - (.073 * mnth_jul) - (.079 * mnth_nov) - (.266 * weathersit_LightSnow_LightRain) - (.084 * weathersit_Mist_Cloudy)
  
  Based on final model top three features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand are: Temperature (0.414) weathersit : weathersit_LightSnow_LightRain (-0.266) year (0.256)
